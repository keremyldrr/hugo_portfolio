Hello, I'm Kerem Yıldırır and this is my personal page. I'm a Master of Informatics student at
Technische Universität München and I'm focusing on 3D Computer Vision research
at 3D AI Lab and working as a part-time Computer Vision Engineer at Isarsoft.

I am specializing in 2D/3D object detection, segmentation and tracking and 3d reconstruction, and working on many exciting Computer Vision projects, which are listed under  [Projects]({{< ref "projects/_index.md" >}}) tab. My hobbies include hiking, boxing and drumming.

If you wish to get in touch, you can find my social media links and email
