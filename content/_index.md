Hello, I'm Kerem Yıldırır and this is my personal page. I'm a Master of Informatics student at
Technische Universität München and I'm heavily focusing on Computer Vision research
while currently working as a working student at the Neutron Imaging Lab at TUM. See the [Curriculum Vitae]({{< ref "resume.md" >}})
tab for my previous work and research experience.

I am working on many exciting Computer Vision projects, which are listed under  [Projects]({{< ref "projects/_index.md" >}}) tab.

If you want to get in touch, you can find my social media links and email
address below.
